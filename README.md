A personal developer portfolio built with **React + Vite + TypeScript + Styled Components**, featuring smooth animations, bilingual-friendly sections, and a clean, modern UI inspired by **Hatsune Miku’s mint–pink color palette**.  
This site introduces my journey, skills, and projects while showcasing the ability to design, build, and deploy production-ready React applications.
